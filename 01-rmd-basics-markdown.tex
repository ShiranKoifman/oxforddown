\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Communication in adverse listening situations where the target speech is incomplete or distorted is a typical everyday occurrence. Often, the sound source of interest is masked by nearby interfering sounds (e.g., traffic noise or competing talkers) or degraded (e.g., due to reverberations, transmission artefacts or filtering). Remarkably however, listeners can often maintain high speech intelligibility even when large portions of the speech signal are physically missing or entirely masked by other sounds (Miller and Licklider 1950; Ba≈ükent et al. 2016). This phenomenon is, among other things, attributed to the redundant characteristics of speech in the spectral and the temporal domain, enabling the listener to piece together short glimpses of the target signal to achieve high speech perception (i.e., {``glimpsing theory''}; Cooke 2006).
The way our auditory system overcomes such impoverished listening conditions is not well understood.
One of the main obstacles when trying to answer this question is the large variation in performance across listeners, in particular in more ecological listening scenarios with several competing talkers with different complex spectro-temporal properties (Surprenant and Watson 2001).
In many cases, such individual differences cannot be explained by hearing sensitivity as measured with pure-tone-audiogram (L. E. Humes and Dubno 2010; Kidd and Humes 2012).
Individual differences may arise from variations in the listeners' auditory processing abilities or their abilities to make use of perceptual acoustic and linguistic information (Pichora-Fuller and Singh 2006; Surprenant and Watson 2001).
In addition, there is an increasing amount of evidence suggesting that variability in speech perception may be in part attributed to variations in cognitive abilities, especially in adverse listening conditions where the distractor is speech or speech-like (see review by Akeroyd 2008; Arlinger et al. 2009; Kidd and Humes 2012; Esch et al. 2013; Larry E. Humes, Kidd, and Lentz 2013).
Understanding what causes certain groups of listeners to experience listening difficulties under challenging listening situations can help us finding better intervention plans or treatments that fit to their individual needs. Moreover, we can use this knowledge to improve currently used speech recognition and speech enhancement techniques.
However, isolating and quantifying the contribution of the different mechanisms involved throughout the auditory system is challenging.\\

The present paper aims to investigate the utility of a novel speech-on-speech listening task that appears to demand higher-level cognitive aspects of listening and may aid in disentangling the reasons why different groups of people experience difficulty in listening in noisy situations. In the task, target speech is interrupted and segmented at a fixed rate. The segments are then alternated between the two ears out-of-phase with an interrupted distractor which is alternated in a similar way, resulting in alternated segments of both signals between the two ears, with only one stimulus present in each ear at any given time. The task necessitates the listeners' ability to switch and sustain their attention on the target speech, while inhibiting the distractor segments, and to integrate the short-term auditory information between the two ears.
A preliminary study (unpublished BSc thesis Akinseye 2015) compared performance in the task across young (mean age: 24, range: 20 - 33 years old) and older adults (mean age: 63, range: 50-72 years old) with audiometrically normal hearing up to 4\textasciitilde kHz. Normal cognitive skills were controlled for the older group using a standard screening test (MoCA; Nasreddine et al. 2005). Interestingly, while no significant difference in speech intelligibility was found between the young and older adults for a ``standard" speech-in-noise test, there was a highly significant difference in performance between the groups, with older adults showing poorer intelligibility for the switching task when presented with connected speech as a distractor. These results suggest that the switching task may demand some higher-level cognitive aspects of listening that are not probed by more simple listening tasks.
The objective here is to investigate different aspects of the task across normal hearing young adults. This includes examining the effect of distractor types (speech vs.~non-speech); intelligibility of the speech distractors; and similarity between the target and the distractor, for same- and opposite-sex distractor talker configurations on the listeners' speech perception. In addition, test-retest reliability and reproducibility of the task's score is evaluated.
To set the context, it is beneficial to review some aspects involved in speech perception in a `Cocktail-party'-like environment (Cherry 1953) as an effect of distractor interference, interruption, and alternation.

\subsection{Experiment II: speech distractors spoken in a familiar vs.~unfamiliar language}\label{experiment-ii-speech-distractors-spoken-in-a-familiar-vs.-unfamiliar-language}}

Findings in the first experiment demonstrated that performance in the task is specifically affected when speech distractors are used, and that this IM effect did not occur for the non-speech distractors. To extend these findings, in the second experiment we examined the contributions to IM of familiarity with the spoken language of the distractor (English vs.~Mandarin), and similarity-related features as in voice characteristics of the talkers (same-sex vs.~opposite-sex talkers). Furthermore, the applicability of the proposed task for future clinical and research use was examined.

To create numbered equations, put them in an `equation' environment and give them a label with the syntax \texttt{(\textbackslash{}\#eq:label)}, like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}begin}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{equation}\NormalTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{ }
\SpecialStringTok{  f}\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}left}\SpecialStringTok{(k}\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}right}\SpecialStringTok{) = }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}binom}\SpecialStringTok{\{n\}\{k\} p\^{}k}\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}left}\SpecialStringTok{(1{-}p}\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}right}\SpecialStringTok{)\^{}\{n{-}k\}}

\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}end}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{equation}\NormalTok{\} }
\end{Highlighting}
