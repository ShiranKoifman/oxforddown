Task,Information,Measure
\textbf{Standard \& extended high-frequency (EHF) audiometry},"Pure-tone detection thresholds measured at the octave frequencies between 0.25 and 8 kHz (standard), and 8 to 20 kHz (EHF).",Detection threshold in dB HL
\textbf{Switching task (ST)} ,Adaptive speech-on-speech listening task that involves perception of interrupted and periodically segmented speech that is switched between the two ears out-of-phase with an interrupted distractor. ST assesses the ability to switch attention and integration of binaural information.,"Proportion of speech required to understand 50\% of the keywords, Speech Reception duty cycle Threshold (SRdT)"
\textbf{Listening in Spatialised Noise Sentences UK (LiSNS-UK)},"Locally developed version of the LiSN-S (Cameron \& Dillon, 2007), an adaptive speech-on-speech listening task that assesses the ability to use spatial release from masking (SRM), measured as the difference in perception between collocated and separated speech distractors. ","Signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) yielding 50\% speech intelligibility, Speech Reception Threshold (SRT)"
\textbf{Speech-shaped-noise (SSN)},"Conventional adaptive speech in noise task that asseses speech perception of ASL sentences (MacLeod \& Summerfield, 1990) in a speech-shaped-noise with a spectrum matched to the ASL material.",SRT
"\textbf{The Environmental Auditory Scene Analysis task, ENVASA} (Leech et al., 2009)",Non-linguistic self-administered task that involves detection of everyday environmental sounds presented in naturalistic auditory scenes and can be used to asses IM effects as well as sustained selective auditory attention skills.,\%-correct
"\textbf{Recalling sentences, CELF-RS} (Wiig et al., 2017) ","A subtest from the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals UK 5$^{th}$  edition (CELF-5-UK) which assesses expressive language skills, measured by the ability to repeat in verbatim sentences with varying length and complexity. Standardised for children aged 5 to 16 years.",Age-corrected scaled scores
"\textbf{The Evaluation of Children's Listening and Processing Skills, ECLiPS} (Barry \& Moore, 2014)","Standardised questionnaire comprised of 38  statements grouped into five categories designed to identify listening and communication difficulties in children aged 6 to 11 years. Respondent agreement is expressed using a five-point Likert scale (""\textit{strongly agree}"" - ""\textit{strongly disagree}""). ",Age-corrected scaled scores
"\textbf{The Children's Communication Checklist 2$^{nd}$ edition, CCC-2} (Bishop, 2003)","Standardised questionnaire comprising 70 items designed to screen language and/or communication problems in children aged 4 to 16 years. Items consist of a behaviour statement (e.g., ""\textit{Mixes up words of similar meaning}"") with respondents asked to judge how often the behaviours occur using a four-point Likert scale (0-3).",Age-corrected scaled scores
