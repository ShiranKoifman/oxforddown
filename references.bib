abstract = {This paper describes a public-domain database of high-spatial-resolution head-related transfer functions measured at the U. C. Davis CIPIC Interface Laboratory. Release 1.0 includes head-related impulse responses for 45 subjects at 25 different azimuths and 50 different elevations (1250 directions) at approximately 5° angular increments. In addition, the database contains anthropometric measurements for each subject. Statistics of anthropometric parameters and correlations between anthropometry and some temporal and spectral features of the HRTFs are reported.},

abstract = {A freely available collection of Head-Related Impulse Response (HRIR) measurements is introduced. The impulse responses were acquired in an anechoic chamber using a KEMAR manikin at four different loud- speaker distances – 3m, 2m, 1m and 0.5m – reaching from the far field to the near field. The loudspeaker was positioned at ear height and the manikin was rotated with a high-precision stepper motor in one degree increments. Besides the raw HRIRs also datasets are available which have been compensated for the use with specific headphone models.},
