abstract = {This paper describes a public-domain database of high-spatial-resolution head-related transfer functions measured at the U. C. Davis CIPIC Interface Laboratory. Release 1.0 includes head-related impulse responses for 45 subjects at 25 different azimuths and 50 different elevations (1250 directions) at approximately 5° angular increments. In addition, the database contains anthropometric measurements for each subject. Statistics of anthropometric parameters and correlations between anthropometry and some temporal and spectral features of the HRTFs are reported.},

@article{Norbury2005,
abstract = {The Children's Communication Checklist (Bishop, 1998) was revised (CCC-2 - Bishop, 2003) to provide a general screen for communication disorder & pragmatic/social interaction deficits. Families of 77 children attending full-time special education for specific language impairment, pragmatic language impairments or autistic spectrum disorders completed the questionnaire. Data were also available from 23 typically developing children. The CCC-2 distinguished children with communication impairments from non-impaired peers. Furthermore, the Social-Interaction Deviance Composite (SIDC) of the CCC-2 identified children with disproportionate pragmatic & social difficulties in relation to their structural language. It is concluded that the CCC-2 provides a useful screening measure for communication impairment & can be helpful in identifying children with more pervasive disorders. However, there was substantial overlap amongst groups, suggesting that it is unrealistic to use the CCC-2 to make categorical distinctions on this continuum of disorder. Tables, Figures, References.

@article{Leech2009,
abstract = {In a non-linguistic analog of the "cocktail-party" scenario, informational and contextual factors were found to affect the recognition of everyday environmental sounds embedded in naturalistic auditory scenes. Short environmental sound targets were presented in a dichotic background scene composed of either a single stereo background scene or a composite background scene created by playing different background scenes to the different ears. The side of presentation, time of onset, and number of target sounds were varied across trials to increase the uncertainty for the participant. Half the sounds were contextually congruent with the background sound (i.e., consistent with the meaningful real-world sound environment represented in the auditory scene) and half were incongruent. The presence of a single competing background scene decreased identification accuracy, suggesting an informational masking effect. In tandem, there was a contextual pop-out effect, with contextually incongruent sounds identified more accurately. However, when targets were incongruent with the real-world context of the background scene, informational masking was reduced. Acoustic analyses suggested that this contextual pop-out effect was driven by a mixture of perceptual differences between the target and background, as well as by higher-level cognitive factors. These findings indicate that identification of environmental sounds in naturalistic backgrounds is an active process that requires integrating perceptual, attentional, and cognitive resources. {\textcopyright} 2009 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {A freely available collection of Head-Related Impulse Response (HRIR) measurements is introduced. The impulse responses were acquired in an anechoic chamber using a KEMAR manikin at four different loud- speaker distances – 3m, 2m, 1m and 0.5m – reaching from the far field to the near field. The loudspeaker was positioned at ear height and the manikin was rotated with a high-precision stepper motor in one degree increments. Besides the raw HRIRs also datasets are available which have been compensated for the use with specific headphone models.},
